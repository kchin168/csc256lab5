This lab is to learn the basic mechanisms of linked data structures, Lists, Stacks, and Queues.

This is a simulation of a supermarket with customers coming, buying products and proceeding to the checkout. To keep track of customers we used a list, for customer's shopping cart we used a stack, and for customers at the checkout we used a queue.
